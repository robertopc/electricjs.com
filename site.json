This file must export an Object, or a function that returns an Object. module.exports = { pathDest: 'build' }; // or module.exports = function() { return { pathDest: 'build' }; }; Options basePath Type: String Default: '' Prefixes all urls used in resources and navigation elements with the supplied path. Example: module.exports = { basePath: '/base-path' }; Now all of the generated navigation elements will be prefixed with this path. Pages It will also prefix the urls the auto-generated script and link tags. This setting can be useful for hosting services such as gh-pages which nest your project under a path generated by your project name. For example, https://electricjs.github.io/project-name/ would require the following config. module.exports = { basePath: '/project-name', deployOptions: { branch: 'gh-pages' } }; codeMirrorLanguages Type: Array Default: ['xml', 'css', 'javascript'] An Array of langauge names for syntax highlighting. See CodeMirror for a list of available languages. codeMirrorTheme Type: String Default: 'dracula' Theme to be used by CodeMirror. See CodeMirror for a list of available themes. deployOptions Type: Object Default: {lb} branch: 'wedeploy' {rb} Configuration options used by the deploy command. See gh-pages for further configuration options. envOptions Type: Object Allows you to set predefined options that can conditionally overwrite the default options from electric.config.js. Example: Let's say you need to deploy to two different branches, envOptions allows you to define a custom set of options that can be enabled via a command line flag. module.exports = { envOptions: { ghpages: { deployOptions: { branch: 'ghpages' } } }, deployOptions: { branch: 'default-branch' } }; Running electric deploy will use the default settings, publishing to the default-branch. However, if you run the following, electric deploy --env ghpages The ghpages options defined above will overwrite the default options, deploying your site to the gh-pages branch. Note: any of the configuration options can be set in envOptions, not just what is seen in the example. frontMatterHook Type: function Allows modifications of your project's front-matter before it's passed to the templates. Example: module.exports = { frontMatterHook: function(data) { data.someValue = 'Hello, World!'; return data; } }; In this example the property someValue will be accessible via the $site parameter in your pages/templates. --- description: \"Page description.\" layout: \"docs\" title: \"Page\" --- {$site.someValue} markdownOptions Type: Object An Object Literal containing configuration options for Remarkable which is used to render Markdown files. Example: module.exports = { markdownOptions: { breaks: true } }; See Remarkable's documentation for list of options. markdownRenderer Type: function|Remarkable Allows complete customization over the markdown renderer. Value can either be instance of Remarkable or a function which receives the default instance of Remarkable as an argument. Example: // New Remarkable instance module.exports = { markdownRenderer: new Remarkable() }; // Function module.exports = { markdownRenderer: function(md) { md.core.ruler.enable([ 'abbr' ]); return md; } }; pathDest Type: String Default: dist The path that generated files are placed in. Example: module.exports = { pathDest: 'build' }; Now all generated files will be placed in the build directory. pathSrc Type: String Default: src The path where all source files are located. Example: module.exports = { pathSrc: 'web' }; Now electric will look inside the web directory for all source files. metalComponents Type: Array Array of npm modules that expose Metal components. These also must be added as npm dependencies in your package.json. Example: module.exports = { metalComponents: ['electric-components'] }; The components found in the electric-components package will now be available to all soy files in your project. Note that every package listed in metalComponents must also be listed as a dependency in the project's package.json. sassOptions Type: Object Config object passed to gulp-sass. Example: module.exports = { sassOptions: { includePaths: ['node_modules/some-package/scss'] } }; staticSrc Type: Array Array of glob patterns for static files found in the options.pathSrc directory. These glob patterns target anything that isn't part of the build system (pages, layouts, styles, etc.). Note: it is not recommended to overwrite this property. uglifyBundle Type: boolean Default: false Determines if bundle files are both minified and uglified. When using electric-cli, this option defaults to true during the deploy task, and defaults to false during all others. Warning: enabling this option can significantly increase build times. vendorSrc Type: Array Default: [] Array of glob patterns for .css and .js files that should be included in the `` of your project. Example: module.exports = { vendorSrc: ['node_modules/some-project/src/min.js'] }; ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/configuration.md","id":"configuration","location":"/docs/configuration.html","url":"/docs/configuration.html"},"getting-started":{"description":"Getting started with a electric project.","icon":"arrow-right-rod","layout":"docs","title":"Getting Started","weight":1,"content":" Electric CLI Install npm i -g electric-cli Initialize Project electric init This will prompt you for a project id and name, then it creates a folder in your current directory with your new electric project.

Any property can be added to this file. Front matter from all pages is merged with this data and passed to every page as a soy param. Layouts The file structure of layouts is flexible, as soy uses the namespace of every file as an identifier. All layout files must be a soy template, and the only required layout is base.soy. See layouts for more information. Pages Every file in pages with a .soy or .md extension is rendered to HTML during the build command. The file structure of pages determines the urls of your pages. For the above example, the child.md file will be located at /docs/parent/child.html after building. Pages named index will be located at the path of it's parent directory, so pages/docs/index.soy will be available at /docs/. See pages for more information.

Inject Tags Inside the base.soy template there are multiple inject tags that are used by electric to import resources and scripts. inject:css/inject:js These tags are used to inject link and script tags for all thirdparty resources located in dist/vendor. inject:metal:js During the generate task they are replaced with the necessary code for automatically invoking Metal components that have been implemented in your project's soy files. Note: these tags only need to be included in the base template. The injected code is what implements the serialized param that is defined at the start of the template. serialized is stringified meta data that Metal consumes to render each page. inject:codemirror:js CodeMirror is responsible for Electric's built in syntax highlighting.
