See CodeMirror for a list of available languages. codeMirrorTheme Type: String Default: 'dracula' Theme to be used by CodeMirror. See CodeMirror for a list of available themes. deployOptions Type: Object Default: {lb} branch: 'wedeploy' {rb} Configuration options used by the deploy command. See gulp-gh-pages for further configuration options. frontMatterHook Type: function Allows modifications of your project's front-matter before it's passed to the templates. Example: module.exports = { frontMatterHook: function(data) { data.someValue = 'Hello, World!'; return data; } }; In this example the property someValue will be accessible via the $site parameter in your pages/templates. --- description: \"Page description.\" layout: \"docs\" title: \"Page\" --- {$site.someValue} markdownOptions Type: Object An Object Literal containing configuration options for Remarkable which is used to render Markdown files.

Value can either be instance of Remarkable or a function which receives the default instance of Remarkable as an argument.

Any property can be added to this file. Front matter from all pages is merged with this data and passed to every page as a soy param. Layouts The file structure of layouts is flexible, as soy uses the namespace of every file as an identifier. All layout files must be a soy template, and the only required layout is base.soy. See layouts for more information. Pages Every file in pages with a .soy or .md extension is rendered to HTML during the build command. The file structure of pages determines the urls of your pages. For the above example, the child.md file will be located at /docs/parent/child.html after building. Pages named index will be located at the path of it's parent directory, so pages/docs/index.soy will be available at /docs/. See pages for more information.

Inject Tags Inside the base.soy template there are multiple inject tags that are used by electric to import resources and scripts. inject:css/inject:js These tags are used to inject link and script tags for all thirdparty resources located in dist/vendor. inject:metal:js During the generate task they are replaced with the necessary code for automatically invoking Metal components that have been implemented in your project's soy files. Note: these tags only need to be included in the base template. The injected code is what implements the serialized param that is defined at the start of the template. serialized is stringified meta data that Metal consumes to render each page. inject:codemirror:js CodeMirror is responsible for Electric's built in syntax highlighting. This script locates all code examples and applies the appropriate syntax highlighting. Sub Layouts Additional layouts can be created in the layouts folder of your project. These layouts are simply soy templates that can be implemented by individual pages. &123;namespace docs&#125; /** @param content @param elementClasses @param page @param site */ &#123;template .render&#125; {$site.title} {$page.title} {$content} &#123;/template&#125; This template can be implemented by both soy and markdown files.
